# Introduction

`mdbook-docker-run` is a little plugin that allows you to run commands and have
the output appear in your book. This is useful when you want to show examples,
such as how to run a particular CLI, and you want these examples to always be
up-to-date.

## Usecase

My usecase for this is writing a primer where I show how various tools work. I
want the output of the tools to be accurate, and not based on me running the
tool once and pasting the output.

However, you can use this plugin for anything you want. If you have a novel
use-case that this tool could help you with, feel free to adopt it or submit
patches to make it work better for your use-case.
